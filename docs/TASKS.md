2. **Port core logic** (bar detection, timestamp mapping) to Dart
3. **Build Flutter UI** incrementally, testing each component
4. **Migrate data files** (bars.json, timestamps.json) to Flutter assets
5. **Test thoroughly** on target platforms (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Initialize Flutter project** and set up dependencies
2. **Port data models** from TypeScript to Dart
3. **Implement PDF viewer** with flutter_pdfview
4. **Implement bar detection** and tap handling
5. **Add YouTube player** integration
6. **Build annotation engine** with CustomPainter
7. **Implement state management** and persistence
8. **Polish UI/UX** and test on multiple platforms
